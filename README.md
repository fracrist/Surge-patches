# Surge-patches
Hi Everyone!

Surge XT is a powerful open source synthesizer, with lots of good ready-to-use patches.

But real fun comes when you start building your sounds, and more fun is when you share them to other musicians.

All patches are public, no restrictions for any (legal) use.

If you like and use them, just let me know. :-)
