# Surge-patches
Hi Everyone!

Surge XT is a powerful open source synthesizer, with lots of good ready-to-use patches.

But real fun comes when you start building your sounds, and more fun is when you share them to other musicians.

## License? Money? Fun!
All patches are public, no restrictions for any (legal) use.

If you like and use them, just let me know. :-)
